## chapter 5 :
 
* i learn how to add img then add height and width *for ex: < img src=" images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of   quokka" width="600" height="450" /> 

* we can add image in :
1. *before a paragraph* 
2.  *InsIde the start of a paragraph* 
3.  *In the mIddle of a paragraph*

* I read how to lsave image .
* Block elements always appear on a new line. 
* Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not start on a new line
* The align attribute can take these horizontal or vertical values:
1. left : This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).
2. right : This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).
3. top : This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.
4. middle : This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.
5. bottom : This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.

 *  we Use GIF or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color
 * Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.
 * Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent
 * You can have more than one image inside the < figure> element 
 * use < figcaption> element to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image
 * i read also about the opacity , how to add color using rgba and background color.
