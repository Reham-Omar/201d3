- When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page.
 These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the page .

* Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
* Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence,
 that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it).

 - HTML has six "levels" of headings: h1 . h2 ,h3 ,h4 , h5 ,h6.
 - <  p  > To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up
  the paragraph with an opening <  p  > tag and closing < /p  > tag.
- <  b  > By enclosing words in the tags <b> and <  /b  > we can make characters appear bold.
- <  i > By enclosing words in the tags <  i  > and <  /i  > we can make characters appear italic.
- <  br /  > As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph
 or heading on a new line
- <   hr /  > To create a break between themes 
- The <  blockquote  > element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. 
- The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph
-  <  dfn  >it is known as the defining instance of it.
- The <  address  > element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.

# chapter 10 :
* Introducing CSS *
 - CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside  X its own box and
  uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the  X elements the rule applies to) 
and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your  X rules at different elements.

- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties  X of the element that you want to change,
 and the values of those properties. 
 *For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the 
 value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.*

- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,  X although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions”

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
 Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
 Statements should end with a semicolon.

 - it contain avery precise instructions like specify the value before make calcultion using that value 
 - it distinguishes between numbers (0-9) , string , and boolean value .
 - expressions evaluate into asingle value 
 - expression relay on operator to calculate a value 

 # Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”

 - A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. 
   * You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
  * If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops 
  the rest of the switch statement running .
