## What is the Domain Modeling ?

the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors and the the constraints that govern the problem domain .

### how to building domain modeling ?

* When modeling a single entity, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
* Model its attributes and beaviour .
* Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
*  then Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its from outside.
*  or Use the "this" variable within methods so you can access the object's  from inside.

## chapter 6 : Table 

## What is the Table ?

A table represents information in a grid format .

* To create a teable in HTML we use < table> then < tr> to start new row then < td> to represent each cell .
* use < th> for table heading .
* **To spanning columns or** use < td colspan="x" > x indicate how many cell should run across it .
* **To spanning rows** use  < td rowspan="y"> y indicate how many cell should run across it .
* for long tables use < thead> ,< tbody> ,  < tfoot>
 
 ## chapter 3 : Functions, Methods, and Objects

 * use NEW to create anew object .
 * ways to create objects :
  1- LITERAL NOTATION 
  2- OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION : *it's used to create multiple objects*

* In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key. 
* Array and object can be used to create complex data set .
